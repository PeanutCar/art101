		<h1>Pseudocode for creating a word search puzzle game:</h1>

		<pre>
			// Creating a word search game:
		  // Print a board with a distinct number of randomized letters
		    // Create a 12x12 grid
		  // Print a “word list” for the user
		    // Make a list of 6 randomized words from a pre-written word bank
		  // Randomly insert words from the list horizontally, vertically, and diagonally
		    // In the remaining spaces, fill each with a randomized letter
		  // Accept user input
		  // Validate user move
		    // Allow the user to use their mouse to interact with the page
		  // Draw a line through words on the board and on “word list”
		    // Allow use of the mosue to draw a line
		      // Line locked to 8 cardinal directions
		      // Whichever cells the line touches are considered part of the attempt
		        // If the letters selected match correctly, then answer is validated
		    // Repeat for all words
		  // Show “complete” and play confetti animation over the board when all words from list are crossed
		</pre>

		<h1>Challenges</h1>
		<p>There weren't any really issues. We were able to make the lists and we thought about ways to break larger tasks into smaller descriptions which seems helpful when writing pseudocode.</p>
		<h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
		None really. What was most difficult was trying to make sure we were answering the tasks of the assignments correctly. More what we were supposed to show in the lab PDF than trouble writing in Atom.</p>
		<h3>Results<h3>
			<p>Figured out how to write pseudocode and how to approach thinking about it. The results were successful I think!</p>
