		<h2>Pseudocode for creating a word search puzzle game:</h2>

		<pre>
			// Creating a word search game:
		  // Print a board with a distinct number of randomized letters
		    // Create a 12x12 grid
		  // Print a “word list” for the user
		    // Make a list of 6 randomized words from a pre-written word bank
		  // Randomly insert words from the list horizontally, vertically, and diagonally
		    // In the remaining spaces, fill each with a randomized letter
		  // Accept user input
		  // Validate user move
		    // Allow the user to use their mouse to interact with the page
		  // Draw a line through words on the board and on “word list”
		    // Allow use of the mosue to draw a line
		      // Line locked to 8 cardinal directions
		      // Whichever cells the line touches are considered part of the attempt
		        // If the letters selected match correctly, then answer is validated
		    // Repeat for all words
		  // Show “complete” and play confetti animation over the board when all words from list are crossed
		</pre>
