  		      			  <h2>Problems</h2>
  		      					 <p>There were problems and a fair amount of struggle till we found the solution. It turns out that it was something small (one missing line) that caused our sorting function to not work. Our value wasn't corresponding to anything in the function, so we weren't getting results until we defined its relation within the function.</p>
  		                 </div>
  		           <div id="content-results">
  		      			  <h2>Results</h2>
  		      				   <p>After adding one line linking our value in the function after hours of experimenting it's working!! The working project takes a name, uses a button, and then prints the sorted name.</p>

                              Input your Name:<br>
