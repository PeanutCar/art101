	<h1>This is Katana Parker.</h1>

		<p>Hey hey. I'm Katana Parker, an art major at UCSC. I've got big dreams and a lot of ideas and zeal! I have some experience doing most types of visual art, but working with 3D is slowly becoming my favorite. I don't know what to say it is I do exactly as an artist. A lot of world-building, I guess. I like art and art history. I'm also into video games. Play a lot of rhythm games, some RPGs, and management or strategy type things when there's time... I'm not too serious and am interested in exploring impractical and fun ideas when it comes to work.</p>

		<p>My birthday is July 22nd. I was born in San Francisco, but grew up in Sacramento. Livermore, California is where I currently reside.</p>

		<p>I consider my creativity my greatest strength; my biggest weakness is how terrible I am at math.</p>
