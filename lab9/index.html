	<h1>Lab 9 - JavaScript for the Web</h1>
		<p>Working with a partner, experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>

	<h2>Problems:</h2>
		<p>Understanding what was going on conceptually. I need to go back and look at the slides and lecture again. I looked at what the professor was doing in their code, but still didn't really understand.</p>

	<h2>Results:</h2>
		<p>I wasn't able to get it working right, so I'll probably submit it again when I feel like I know what I'm doing. My partner found a different solution and was able to make it work though.</p>
