	<h1>Lab 9 - JavaScript for the Web</h1>
		<p>Working with a partner, experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>

	<h2>Problems:</h2>
		<p>This is a second submission of this assignment. I realized that a lot of the problems I was facing could have been solved with more experimentation in the console. I was on the right track, but I didn't really understand what I was doing at the time.</p>

	<h2>Results:</h2>
		<p>It's working now! I was making it more complicated than neccessary before. Checking everything in the console would have made this a lot easier. Now I know how to use it to better serve making this stuff work. Now I know how to change or add things with the DOM.</p>
