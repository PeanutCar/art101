	<h1>Lab 8 Anon Functions and Callbacks:</h1>
		<p>Working with a partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>

	<h2>Problems:</h2>
		<p>There was one issue with a paranthesis being in the wrong spot in the console.log, but after moving it the function began working correctly in the console, returning true/false.</p>

	<h2>Results:</h2>
		<p>My partner and I were able to get the functions to return the correct results after calling back the funtions.</p>
