	<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
		<p>Working with your partner, experiment with jQuery and AJAX.</p>


	<h2>Problems:</h2>
		<p>We were unable to figure out how to make a particular api work. My partner wanted to use an api that returned pictures of dogs instead of cats like in the professors example. For some reason the "get" part of the AJAX wasn't working and returned nothing ("404").</p>


	<h2>Results:</h2>
		<p>We were able to get the basics up and running, getting an API endpoint to return its data in our output. You can see it working by pressing the button bellow.</p>

		<div id="output">
