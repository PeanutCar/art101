	<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
		<p>With a partner, use your debugging knowledge to fix old assignments.</p>

	<h2>Debugging:</h2>
			<p>I didn’t turn in a working lab 9 the first time (though I think I got 10/10 already on the assignment?). The next two images are screenshots from my original submission where the function wasn’t running. I figured out later that a lot of the problems I was facing could have been solved by running tests in the console. I fixed the webpage a day or two after my original submission. Looking back, the way I was trying to manipulate the DOM didn’t make sense, something I would have realized if I were utilizing the console and seeing if it did anything. As an art student, I know as soon as I’m guessing and not being intentional, it means work is probably going in a bad direction, which was the case with my original submission. “.innerHTML” makes sense and works since that does what the lab asked for, inserting in the text. I know that that’s a method that works and manipulates DOM elements, unlike the guessing I was doing previously.

Additionally, though I’m not certain, adding more details to the CSS attributes helped me make sure things were actually being affected when the webpage loaded.

	<h2>Problems:</h2>
		<p>There are probably some more differences between my original submission and the one I referenced in my lab reportS. Though the main idea was that I realized I was totally failing without testing anything originally</p>

	<h2>Results:</h2>
		<p>Lab 9 is actually done and has been presented and turned in now.</p>
