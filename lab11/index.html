	<h1>Lab 11 - Libraries & jQuery</h1>
		<p>Working with a partner, experiment with jQuery.</p>

		<div id="challenges" class="sectionbox"></div>

	<h2>Problems:</h2>
		<p>This one wasn't too difficult. The only problem we ran into was linking the jQuery with our JavaScript. We needed the longer code from the jQuery site. We also ran into problems with the CSS causing the buttons not to work. Also, my internet went down towards the end of the assignment...</p>

		<div id="problems" class="sectionbox"></div>

	<h2>Results:</h2>
		<p>We were able to use jQuery to help us make the buttons. We made buttons that listened for clicks and then changed CSS elements when pressed.</p>
