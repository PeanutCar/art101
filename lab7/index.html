	<h1>Lab 7 Functions:</h1>
		<p>Working with a partner to write functions that take user input.</p>

	<h2>Problems:</h2>
		<p>It was somewhat difficult to understand what was going on conceptually in the JavaScript functions for me but I think I got it mostly in the end. Another issue we ran into was keeping track of capitalization in the JavaScript files, which caused things to not work at first.</p>

	<h2>Results:</h2>
		<p>We were able to get everything working after fixing those minor naming issues we were having. If you got to see this page and a response after putting a name in, then everthing is running properly.</p>

	<h3>Script Output</h3>
		<div class=output>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>
