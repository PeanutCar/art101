	<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
		<p>Working with your partner, experiment with loops.</p>


	<h2>Problems:</h2>
		<p>The main problems we faced initially were getting the results from the console to print on the page. We got the output to give a few different responses</p>


	<h2>Results:</h2>
		<p>Changing the function to using strings, we were eventually able to get it working and printing on the page. We needed to seek outside help from one of our peers who was able to help walk us through it. Clicking the button, you can see the results of the function.</p>
