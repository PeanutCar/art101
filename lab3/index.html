	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
		<p>for this lab I had to create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files</p>
	<h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
		<p>Creating the file structure and index.html files were easy. What was most challenging was getting an image to show up correctly on my home page. Eventually though, I figured out that the image wasn't linking right because the folder name ("img") the image file was in wasn't specified.</p>
	<h3>Results<h3>
		<p>Because I figured out how to add the images earlier I can now show you what my local file structure looks like:</p>

		<img src="img/file-structure.png" alt="file-structure">
		<p>The html source code within Atom:</p>
		<img src="img/code-for-page.png" alt="html-atom-image">
		<p>Everything as it should be working here on this page:</p>
		<img src="img/page-in-browser.png" alt="this-page-itself">
